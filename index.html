                <h2>Species Overview</h2>
                <p>Honey gouramis are charming little aquatic puppies, hailing from the slow, plant-filled rivers and ponds of India and Bangladesh. Their calm, gentle personalities make them perfect companions for peaceful community tanks, while their warm golden hues bring a soft glow to any aquascape. Males, in particular, turn a dazzling amber-orange with a black belly during breeding season. These petite fish usually live four to six years, delighting their keepers with subtle, curious behaviors and a touch of personality that grows over time. Beginner-friendly yet full of character, honey gouramis truly shine in calm, heavily planted tanks where they can explore, hide, and show off their graceful, gliding movements.</p>

                <h2>Tank Setup</h2>
                <p>A comfortable, well-designed habitat allows honey gouramis to shine, showcasing their colors, confidence, and natural grace.</p>

                <h3>Recommended Tank Size</h3>
                <p>A 10- to 20-gallon tank provides a generous and stable environment for a pair or small group. Larger volumes help buffer water changes and simplify long-term maintenance. While they aren't fast swimmers, honey gouramis appreciate horizontal space and quiet corners where they can retreat. A roomier tank also makes it easier to choose compatible tank mates and aquascaping layouts. Starting with a slightly larger tank often results in happier, more vibrant fish.</p>

                <h3>Aquascape</h3>
                <p>Honey gouramis love planted tanks, especially those with floating plants that diffuse the light and offer surface security. Dense vegetation, branches, and soft shadows create a calm atmosphere where they feel safe enough to show natural behavior. They tend to glide between stems, gently exploring pockets of cover like tiny jungle explorers. Slow-flow filtration is best, as strong currents can stress these delicate swimmers. When the aquascape feels lush and peaceful, honey gouramis become noticeably more relaxed and colorful.</p>

                <h3>Tank Mates</h3>
                <p>Because they're gentle and easily intimidated, honey gouramis thrive with peaceful companions that won't outcompete or harass them. Ideal tank mates include small rasboras, peaceful tetras, corydoras, and shrimp. Avoid fin-nippers or overly energetic species that may overwhelm their quiet nature. A calm community allows honey gouramis to remain active, curious, and social rather than hiding. When kept with the right neighbors, they contribute to a soothing and harmonious aquarium dynamic.</p>

                <h3>Maintenance</h3>
                <p>Consistent maintenance is the secret to keeping honey gouramis happy and vibrant over the long term. Clean, steady water reduces stress and helps them maintain strong coloration and health. Regular partial water changes, gentle filter cleaning, and monitoring parameters make a noticeable difference. They don't tolerate sudden shifts well, so gradual adjustments are always preferred. With predictable care, honey gouramis reward hobbyists with calm behavior and long, steady lives.</p>

                <h2>Diet & Feeding</h2>
                <p>A balanced, diverse diet brings out the best in honey gouramis, enhancing their color, energy, and friendliness.</p>

                <h3>Staple Foods</h3>
                <p>High-quality micro pellets or fine flakes should form the foundation of their diet, providing essential nutrients in a manageable size. Honey gouramis have small mouths, so soft or tiny foods are best. They often enjoy picking at food slowly rather than rushing, which adds a relaxed rhythm to feeding time. A good staple diet helps support immune health and consistent activity. When fed well, these fish glow with healthy color and smooth movement.</p>

                <h3>Live & Frozen Treats</h3>
                <p>Live and frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, daphnia, or cyclops add excitement and variety to their routine. These treats mimic natural hunting behaviors, encouraging gentle bursts of activity. Honey gouramis often show more vivid colors after eating higher-protein foods. Offering treats a few times a week keeps them engaged without overwhelming their digestive system. This little boost of enrichment makes feeding a highlight for both fish and keeper.</p>

                <h3>Feeding Frequency</h3>
                <p>Feeding once or twice per day in small, manageable portions keeps honey gouramis healthy without polluting the water. They prefer slow, thoughtful eating, so giving them time to finish helps reduce leftover waste. Overfeeding can cloud water and stress them, so moderation is key. Many hobbyists enjoy watching their calm, delicate movements during feeding sessions. Regular feeding builds trust, and over time, gouramis often swim up to greet their keepers.</p>
